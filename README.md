## The Challenge

We've all been there: you snag a great deal on Groupon or a similar site, only to find the coupon stuck in your email inbox, non-transferable, and at the mercy of a central authority. No way to resell it if plans change, no proof of true ownership, and certainly no vibrant secondary market. It's frustrating—and it locks value away from users who could otherwise share, trade, or even collaborate on group buys.

## How We're Fixing It

AgoraDeals flips the script with a decentralized platform that's built for real-world utility. Coupons become NFTs you can own outright, trade on a marketplace, or gift to friends. Redemption happens on-chain for tamper-proof verification, and we've layered in features like group deals with escalating discounts, a reputation system to reward active users, and location-aware discovery to surface nearby steals. It's a fluid economy where deals aren't just consumed—they circulate.

## Under the Hood

Our stack keeps things lean and scalable:

## What We've Built

### Key Features
We've nailed the core loop and then some:
- **NFT Coupon Creation**: Using Metaplex standards and SPL tokens for seamless minting.
- **QR Redemption**: Time-bound tickets with crypto-backed proofs—no more fakes.
- **Marketplace Trading**: List for fixed prices, run auctions, or just browse.
- **Group Buys**: Pool funds via escrow for bigger discounts as more join.
- **User Rep**: Climb from Bronze to Diamond tiers, snag NFT badges along the way.
- **Community Vibes**: Rate, comment, and like to build trust.
- **Local Focus**: Deals pop up based on your spot on the map.
- **Merchant Tools**: A dashboard for crafting deals and tracking performance.

### Tech Breakdown
- **Contracts**: Rust via Anchor.
- **Front End**: Next.js 14 with the App Router.
- **Data Layer**: MongoDB for user profiles and indexing.
- **Wallets**: Plug-and-play with Phantom, Backpack, or Solflare.
- **Storage**: Local files for now, wired for S3.
- **APIs**: Clean REST routes handled in Next.js.

## Tackling the Tough Web3 Bits

Building on Solana meant confronting real hurdles head-on. Here's how we did it.

### 1. Making Coupons Feel Like NFTs
**The Hurdle**: Coupons need metadata like expiry dates and discount details, but they have to be truly unique and transferable.

**Our Take**: We leaned on Metaplex for metadata (discounts, merchants, etc.) and SPL for transfers. URIs point to IPFS for longevity. It's straightforward ownership without the fluff.

Peek at the code in [`anchor/programs/agoradeals/src/instructions/mint_coupon.rs`](anchor/programs/agoradeals/src/instructions/mint_coupon.rs).

### 2. Redemption Without the Middleman
**The Hurdle**: How do you confirm a coupon's used without trusting a server?

**Our Take**: A two-part on-chain dance—user generates a short-lived QR hash, merchant scans and burns the NFT. Five-minute expiry kills replay risks.

Details in [`anchor/programs/agoradeals/src/instructions/redemption_tickets.rs`](anchor/programs/agoradeals/src/instructions/redemption_tickets.rs).

### 3. Hiding the Web3 Plumbing
**The Hurdle**: Crypto UX can scare off everyday shoppers.

**Our Take**: Ditch the jargon—"Your Account" instead of "Wallet." We added email sign-ins that spin up embedded wallets, tossed in gasless redemptions for starters, and prepped fiat ramps.

See it live in [`frontend/src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx`](frontend/src/contexts/WalletContext.tsx).

### 4. Easy Wins for Merchants
**The Hurdle**: Small shops shouldn't need a PhD in blockchain to list deals.

**Our Take**: A step-by-step wizard with templates for common spots like eateries or spas. CSV uploads for bulk, and it all hides the chain under the hood.

Core logic in [`frontend/src/app/merchant/create/page.tsx`](frontend/src/app/merchant/create/page.tsx).

### 5. Keeping the Marketplace Buzzing
**The Hurdle**: Without liquidity, trading's a ghost town.

**Our Take**: Options for fixed sales or auctions (English, Dutch, sealed). Escrow locks in safety, with a modest 2.5% cut to keep things running.

Implementation via [`anchor/programs/agoradeals/src/instructions/auctions.rs`](anchor/programs/agoradeals/src/instructions/auctions.rs).

```

## Hook Into the API

Our public endpoints live at `/api/v1/*`. Try fetching nearby deals:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/deals?lat=6.5244&lng=3.3792&radius=5000
```

You'll get something like:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "deals": [
      {
        "id": "...",
        "title": "50% Off Pizza",
        "merchant": "Pizza Palace",
        "discountPercentage": 50,
        "price": 1500,
        "distance": 1200
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Everything's covered in **[the API docs](./API_DOCUMENTATION.md)**—70+ routes, fully spec'd out.

## Testing It Out
